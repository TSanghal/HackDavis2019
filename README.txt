This project was created during Davis's 2019 Hackathon for Social Good. My team and I decided to build something related to the recent bouts of California wildfires. 

We built a sensor that took in temperature readings from its surroundings. (If we were to fully develop the device, this it would have more sensors like some for humidity and air quality.) 

We then developed a simple webpage that would allow users to input their location and discover whether the area they were in had conditions that were conducive to wildfires. We were able to develop this by using the Google Maps API to find the closest sensor to the individual and read its data (although we uploaded our project with hardcoded values). Once we read the data, we could use that information to determine whether or not that location was dangerous or safe. 

In the future, a device like this could be used to collect data on wildfire conditions and create accurate alert systems for fires (possibly even similar to tsunami warning systems) using sophisticated machine learning algorithms.
