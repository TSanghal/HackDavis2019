"This program takes a location input from the user and finds the closest sensor. Then, it reads the temperature from that sensor notifies the user whether they
are in an area that is in danger of having a wildfire or not. Currently, the temperature value from the sensor is a dummy value that we input because of issues
with server connection. This kind of project would eventually have multiple sensors, and various readings from them (not just temperature). It would also
probably use a database and more of a machine learning algorithm (rather than comparing temperature values)."
